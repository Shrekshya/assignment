  <div class="left">As I previously stated on my portfolio page on this site, I will write about the web development assignment that we were assigned with completing in order to gain experience. To shed more light on the allotted assignment, it was about creating our own website with five separate pages, which we completed. Because it was our first project after enrolling in the institution, we were all a little unsure about what we were supposed to do for the assignment. We were all a little panicked about what we should do and what we shouldn't do at the time. However, with the assistance of our course instructor, we were able to get our assignments started. Because the task consisted of five separate pages, I began with the first one, the introduction. Because I am not very computer literate, it was difficult for me to use html and CSS to design my webpage. As a result, I attempted to keep my website as simple as possible while also making it attractive. For my home page, I provided a brief introduction about myself and put menu bars to the top right of the page, which can be used to navigate to the other four pages of my website. I was able to add the menu bars to my home page with the assistance of the university slides. Because pastel colors are currently in style, I attempted to incorporate some light colors into my website. I also added a footer with the words "Learn more" because it appeared to be a bit empty. After finishing my home page, I began working on my contact page, as we had just learnt how to create a form using HTML. Making the contact page wasn't too difficult because I already had an idea for the form, but the assignment required us to have the form run the user's email program, which was a hassle because I had no prior experience with it. Another significant challenge for me was creating a website that was responsive and included a hamburger icon. I had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. I looked it up on Google and YouTube and tried to recreate it as if it were a video, but I was unable to complete it. Despite watching a 30-minute film, I was unable to complete it. I'm still looking for videos on how to construct a hamburgericon, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to complete it.  </div>
  <div class="middle">With my pages I had some challenges on the layouts and all but with the help of my teacher and my friend I was able to fix it. I just added a picture and grids to my portfolio website. On the grid I gave little introduction about myself. On the portfolio page, I put days from my schooling and high school. The portfolio page was superior than the other pages since it had more writing than code. The portfolio page has the same color scheme as the other pages.The portfolio page took less time to complete than the other pages. Then there was the blog page, which I am now working on. It's kind of fun to create a blog because it includes all of the specifics regarding my assignment and the changes/progress I've made. Because everyone like to accomplish things that are simple for them, I find that writing is easier than coding. The sitereport page came next. On this page, we were supposed to write about our overall experience with the course module. I was able to complete it without feeling rushed because it included writing.</div>  
  <div class="right">Nothing comes without a battle and a lot of effort. This task taught me that hard work and perseverance are essential for a successful conclusion. I couldn't give it my all because it was my first assignment. In the future, I aspire to become more comfortable with computers and be able to exhibit the same design on the screen as I did on paper. I'm not sure what grade I'll get, but let's hope for the best and remain optimistic.</div>
