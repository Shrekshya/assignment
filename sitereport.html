		<div class=grid4>As stated in the assignment, we should include information about our experience learning the fundamentals of web development, coding, design, and debugging in our sitereport, I will write about my experience during the project. As I previously stated on my blog page, this project was our university's first ever assignment. When my codes didn't work, I panicked, but I had a lot of pleasure picking out my favorite background colors. Completing this task was difficult and frustrating for me because I am still unfamiliar with computers. However, after going through a period, we always discover something new. So I'm hoping that the experience I gained while working on my first assignment would help me with future tasks. When it comes to the course module and the learning experience, using tags like float, flex, and so on was a lot of fun. My next challenge was to use GitHub. I had never heard of it before and was completely unfamiliar with all of the Git instructions, but with the guidance of our course instructor, I was able to use Github and create my own repository. During our classes, our course instructor was quite helpful. If there were any issues, he would hold supplementary classes on the subject. The university's slides were also quite helpful in comprehending the material. As I previously stated on my blog, I attempted to keep my pages as simple as possible because it is still difficult for me to employ many tags and codes to produce high-quality sites. The colors I chose were inspired by the current trend of pastel colors. The website's design is straightforward and unremarkable. Most of the websites I visit have a similar design, so there isn't one in particular that has affected me. I was annoyed at points while working on the project since the codes I used didn't function and I didn't know what I should be doing. I watched a lot of videos on the subject but couldn't figure it out. The assignment may appear simple to some, but it was quite challenging for me because I knew very little about codes and tags. However, this assignment provided me with fresh experience, and I intend to use it to improve my abilities to create better websites in the future.
