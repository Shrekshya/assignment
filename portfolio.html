I did my schooling from a local school situated in chabahil named Clinton School and did my plus two(+2) from Nami College where science was my major. Currenly I am studying Bsc.computing here in Nami itself. I have always been an optimist and a really hard working student, thus was also appreciated by my teachers for the work I used to do. I secured good results during my school times and was an impeccable student even during my high school. I had always shared an interst on studying It because it is comprehensive and has wider scope not just in Nepal but also around the world. It's a field which challenges a person intellectually and I aleays loved challenging my brain as it helps making my work look credible and creative. I am enthusiastic, loyal and determined. I always show extreme amount of passion for everything I do. I am a strong woman with high moral conduct who also believes in spreading kindness and compassion in whatever she does. I am often described as charismatic, vibrant and helpful by my friendds and teachers but I still know my roots and I believe in humility which keeps me grounded and humble. Henceforth, my portfolio is an actual representation of my educational background and an honest description of myself.</div>
